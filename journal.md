I think that working in a virtual store would not be benifitting to the real work force. Without real workers in the world things that break down would not be able to get fixed at all. If virtual stores were ran what would happen to the real stores? I hypothosize that if there was only virtual stores getting grocries would be more difficult in the case of an emergency.

My idea for an AI project would be to help game devolpers create complex coding systems and UI interfaces. This would help by cutting time and or costs for devolping a game. Furthermore you could save/download the asset and custumize it to your liking.
