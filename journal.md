 In my opion I dont mind tik tok getting banned and if i was a developer for tik tok i would add parental controls so parents can block and custimize their childs feed and what type of content they can and cant see.

The prase 6 7 is often used as a humourous term. For example "The test will have 6 to 7 questions", "6 7!". The tone for it is never serious and always in a joking tone.

I think that working in a virtual store would not be benifitting to the real work force. Without real workers in the world things that break down would not be able to get fixed at all. If virtual stores were ran what would happen to the real stores? I hypothosize that if there was only virtual stores getting grocries would be more difficult in the case of an emergency.

My idea for an AI project would be to help game devolpers create complex coding systems and UI interfaces. This would help by cutting time and or costs for devolping a game. Furthermore you could save/download the asset and custumize it to your liking.

Me personally I would not allow things such as AI tools or technolgy because it could possibly distrupt the learning flow for students by letting them get away with the AI doing work for them and that wouldnt be benifecial for students to not challange their brains and gain knowledge.

The peop;e who will be most affected by the loss of fundinf for SNAP will be the people without a steady income or those who dont make enough money already. With our techolgy we can set up fundraisers to help those in need of food and money. Without techolgy to help those in need we could send checks of money to a fundraising place for the SNAPS or food. I would solve food insecurity by making food have little to no tax on it and ake food slightly cheaper for the less fortunate.
